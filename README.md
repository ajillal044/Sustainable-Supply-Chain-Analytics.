# Sustainable Trade and Transport: Insights at the Intersection of Supply Chains and Environmental Impact

## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project explores how trade dynamics and transport infrastructure investment influence environmental sustainability within global supply chains. It highlights the relationship between rising export activity, increased investment in transport infrastructure, and declining pollutant emissions, demonstrating the evolution towards more sustainable logistics practices.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 📊 Interactive dashboards visualizing trade, transport, and environmental data.
* 🌐 Comparative analysis of trade volume, transport investment, and emission trends.
* 📈 Insights into the relationship between transport investment and trade volume.
* 🌱 Analysis of emission reductions linked to sustainable logistics practices.
